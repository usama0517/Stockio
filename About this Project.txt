 Why I decided to build Stockiyo?
-->I have worked as a sales for a distrbution buissness and because it was a family buissness i had an overlaping responsiblity. for me the hardest part
was not saling the product but the hardest part was managing the stock when the product was loaded on the car i counted them then after the sales operation 
i will count the remaining i will subtract from the total amount the one which are sold or discarded and i will also calculate the revenue and i will report
to my mom. i was using microsoft excel and a notebook for maintainig data so now as a software enginner i think that at that time if i got some software
application it might have make my work easier and i also know people who are still strugling in buissness and who still uses pen and paper for maintaining
and managing their buissness so because of the problem i faced before and because of the problem some people are facing today i decided to build Stockiyo
a tool that will save you time and effort in managing your stock and calculating your revenue.
